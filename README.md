## 💡 Key Insights ("A Tale of Three Strategies")

1.  **The Soviet Workhorse:** Historically, the USSR dominated via volume (185 launches in peak years). However, post-Soviet budget cuts have significantly eroded this lead, leaving Russia with an aging fleet.
2.  **The US Commercial Pivot:** The USA successfully transitioned from government-led programs (NASA Shuttle era) to a booming commercial sector. Private companies like SpaceX have revitalized the American launch cadence.
3.  **The New Bipolar Era:** The data suggests a new rivalry is forming not between Russia and the US, but between **US Commercial Innovation** and **China's State Ambition**.
